# BreakingAndEntering_PocketGuide
<h2>Breaking & Entering</h2>
<h4>A Pocket Guide for Friendly Remote Admins</h4>

This book has been an ongoing yet rewarding personal project I authored and designed as a pocket reference for professionals in the fields of cyber security and network administration. The book is intended to be a concise and comprehensive collection of technical information, tables, commands and techniques presented in a pared down desk companion. My goal was to produce an attractive, easy to navigate guide that could be just as helpful to security professionals as The Little Know It All: Common Sense For Designers is to graphic designers. What you see below is the V1.1 printed edition which is the first finalized version.

Special thanks to [@kaylanm](https://github.com/kaylanm) for all proofreading and help with the final pre-production checks!
Special thanks also to Bishop Fox for the opportunity to collaborate together!

Thanks for stopping by!
