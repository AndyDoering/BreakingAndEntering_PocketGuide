## Breaking & Entering: A Pocket Guide for Friendly Remote Admins

This book has been an ongoing yet rewarding personal project I authored and designed as a pocket reference for professionals in the fields of cyber security and network administration. The book is intended to be a concise and comprehensive collection of technical information, tables, commands and techniques presented in a pared down desk companion. My goal was to produce an attractive, easy to navigate guide that could be just as helpful to security professionals as [The Little Know It All: Common Sense For Designers](https://www.abebooks.com/9783899551679/Little-Know-It-All-Common-Sense-Designers-3899551672/plp?cm_sp=plped-_-1-_-image) is to graphic designers. What you see below is the V1.1 printed edition which is the first finalized version.
